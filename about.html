      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="profile.jpeg" alt="Cyrus Asgari" class="profile-pic">
      <p>I like solving complex technical challenges that have real-world impact. I like to wear hats as an engineer, data scientist, product manager, and leader.</p>
      <p>I spent four years at Harvard where I earned a Bachelors degree in Applied Math and Master's degree in Computational Science & Engineering. I took (a lot of) classes focused on
       machine learning and optimization, while also indulging in economics (earning a secondary) as well as other cool topics like linguistics. I decided to spend some time over at MIT,
       enrolling in really cool graduate coursework in the fields of computer vision and sensorimotor learning for sequential decision making.</p>
      <p>Outside of classes I was heavily involved in robotics, serving as the Co-President of the Harvard Undergraduate Robotics Club for two years and working on some really cool projects.
       I also was involved with the Product Lab group, serving as a product team leader and working with companies like Strava and Oracle. I gave some insights which appeared useful and were 
       incorporated by our partners. I spent time researching reinforcement learning and methods of uncertainty quantification under Prof. Koumoutsakos, developing uncertainty-aware policy gradient
       methods for improved sample efficiency and robustness. I also dedicated a large chunk of my free time to teaching. I taught courses in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems, Applied Linear Algebra
       and Big Data, and Systems Development. I developed a love for teaching!</p>
      <p>I also spent some time in various industry roles. Most recently, I have worked as a machine learning engineer at LinkedIn within their ads org. I worked on cross-domain graph neural networks
       to improve CTR. Prior to that, I worked at Biospectal, a startup developing an app to measure blood pressure using a phone camera. I developed a system for monitoring longitudinal
       data and detecting any aberrations. I also spent a summer at Amazon as a software engineer, developing a skinnable video player to expand their adaptive bitrate streaming tech to other orgs like
       Twitch or Music.</p>
